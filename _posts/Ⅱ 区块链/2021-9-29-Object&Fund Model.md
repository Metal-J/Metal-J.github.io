## Dynamics analysis

### Ⅰ - Power to get people to invest money

- Object’s price is **Rising**
- Object seller's **Credit**  - Freely sell the object in exchange for money

### Ⅱ - Power to raise object’s price

- According to **Definition** : If you want prices to rise, people need to invest money.
- According to **Ⅰ - Power to get people to invest money** : If you want people to invest money, prices need to rise.

**Inference** : it is necessary to introduce other forces that drive people to invest money to break the start-up deadlock.

### Ⅲ - Power to get people to invest money - Triggering

- Object is of great practical **Value** - what's more, a **belief** or **commitment** that the object’s valve will raise is also a kind of value.

**Inference** : When the investment behavior is triggered and the object price rises, the main forces that drive people to invest changes from **Ⅲ** to **Ⅰ** and form a cycle.

Those who buy objects at the point (数量×价格，与最高点形成最大价格差？) can get **the maximum** profit by selling and smashing the price at **the highest** price point (need to be proof).
