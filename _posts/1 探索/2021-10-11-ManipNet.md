Given the wrist and object trajectories(物体运动轨迹), the system is able to synthesize(合成) dexterous manipulation of the object based on the proposed hand-object spatial representation at interactive frame rate, such as (a) the right hand grasps and holds a teapot while the left hand regrasps a mug and (b) the right hand turns a torus in hand.
